## The Monty language
                                        
According to Helberton School, Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just li
ke Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to cr
eate an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.                                                                         
                                                                                                                       
## Monty byte code files                                        
                                                                                                                       
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not 
required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number
 of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:                         
                                                                                                                       
This project is about implementing the _C stacks and queues, fifo and lifo_ with the monty language.
